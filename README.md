# -Heart-Attack-Analysis-Prediction.-Feature-Selection-by-ARM-

The project involves the analysis and prediction of heart attacks based on a dataset containing 
various health-related features. The dataset includes information such as age, sex, exercise
induced angina, number of major vessels, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol 
levels, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, 
and a target variable indicating the likelihood of a heart attack (0 for less chance, 1 for more 
chance). The goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify individuals into 
these two categories, helping in early detection and prevention of heart attacks. The project 
will utilize Association Rule Mining (ARM) for feature selection, aiming to identify the most 
relevant features that contribute to the prediction of heart attacks. The selected features will 
then be used to train machine learning models for heart attack prediction.
